# I used Array#select which takes block as a parameter and returns all matches in an Array
# I used String#include? method which takes a parameter and returns true if there is a match and false otherwise 
# I used Hash#select which is same as Array#select but takes both key value pairs as block parameters
# I used Hash#keys method which returns list of keys of corresponding hash in an Array

# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 

# 1) I used .map! which is a destructive method that produces a new array 
# containing the results of running the block of code for each element of 
# the array it's used on

# 2) I used .sort which sorts the elements of an array in ABC order
# (numbers before uppercase letters before lowercase letters)

# 3) I used .uniq which removes duplicate elements in the returned array
# 4) I used .sort_by which sorts a hash using a set of keys and values

# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# Array#delete_if and Hash#delete_if which takes a block and deletes elements from an array
# or Hash related to any condition written in the blok.
# String#include? which takes a parameter and returns a boolean if it finds
# the parameter passed in the string.
# #class which returns the class of the object,
