# U1.W3: Calculate a letter grade!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# The input is an ARRAY of numbers (0 to 100)
# The output is a letter grade that represents the average 
# of the numbers in the ARRAY.

# DEFINE a method and name it get_grade that will pass an array as a parameter
# IN THE BODY of the method DEFINE a variable, name it result and give it a value = to 0
# CALL the each method to the array and create a small block of code inside {} where 
# you define each element of the array as x using || right after that make result to increase +=
# the value of x on each iteration.
# DEFINE average by dividing result by array length.
# USE the condition statement CASE for the variable average to return a letter grade
# when average is between 90 and 100 return A
# when average is between 80 and 89 return B
# when average is between 70 and 79 return C
# when average is between 60 and 69 return D
# Otherwise return F
# END make sure that you end the method


# 2. Initial Solution

def get_grade (array)
	result = 0
	array.each {|x| result += x}
	average = result / (array.length)
	
	case average
      when 90..100
      return "A"
     when 80...90
      return "B"
     when 70...80
      return  "C"
     when 60...70
      return  "D"
     else
      return  "F"
   end
	
end


# 3. Refactored Solution

def get_grade (array)
	
	average = array.inject(0){|memo, n| memo + n} / (array.length)
	 
	case average
      when 90..100
      "A"
     when 80...90
      "B"
     when 70...80
      "C"
     when 60...70
      "D"
     else
      "F"
   end
	
end
